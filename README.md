### 2. Array Manipulation
Implementation of functions to demonstrate the use of array methods, including:
- **Push**: Adding elements to the end of an array.
- **Unshift**: Adding elements to the beginning of an array.

### 3. Multiplication Table
A program that generates a multiplication table for a number entered by the user.

### 4. User Input Handling
Interactive functionality that allows users to input data, which is then processed by the above programs.

## Technologies Used
